OBJECTIVE:
Create a heads-up no-limit hold 'em poker game.

GAME DESCRIPTION:
The game two-player and is turn-based.
Initially, each player is dealt two cards, each player has a turn. If noone folds, the game continues.
Next, a 3-card flop is dealt.  Each player has another turn.  If noone folds, the game continues.
Next, a 1-card turn is dealt.  Each player has another turn.  If noone folds, the game continues.
Finally, a 1-card river is dealt.  Each player has another turn.  If noone folds, the two players' hands are compared, and the strongest hand wins.
Whoever wins the hand wins the chips that were bet in the hand, and the loser loses the same corresponding number of chips.

GAME REQUIREMENTS:
1) The game requires each player to be dealt two random (unique) cards, from a deck of 52-cards.
If/when the flop/turn/river are dealt, those cards need to be unique also, so the game needs to have some form of state.
The game needs to 'remember' which cards have previously been dealt during the hand.

2) After each hand, the 'state' of dealt cards should be reset before the next hand.
Some persistent state needs to be maintained though -- this time remembering how many chips each of the two players has won/lost.

3) The game needs various action buttons specific to poker (raise, fold, call, bet, check ,etc).

STEPS:
1) Use a RNG to deal each of the two players two (unique) cards from a deck of cards.
2) Allow each player to 'act', from the list of actions in step 3 in 'game requirements'.
